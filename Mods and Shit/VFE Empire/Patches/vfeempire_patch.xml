            <description>Ariadne got tired of the unpredictability of the nobility, and whilst she will create a story of increasing tension, she knows it’s not fun to kick someone while they’re down.\n\nBad events will occur each time Ariadne sees your wealth go up by 5k. For instance, a colony worth 100k will have had 20 bad events.</description>
