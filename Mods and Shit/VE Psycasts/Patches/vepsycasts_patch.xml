            <description>Basilicus enforces the will of the emperor wherever he goes, bestowing great powers on those who deserve it. Epic ballads become even more fantastic if everyone has access to psychic powers.\n\nStories told by Basilicus have a much larger chance of featuring low-level psycasters in raids, caravans, and everywhere inbetween.</description>
