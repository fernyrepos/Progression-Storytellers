            <description>Perry Persistent conveys a story the same way he handles his investigations - with determination and attention to details. Each day can lead him closer to the end of his investigation.\nWith Perry, events occur nearly every day. Colony population is lenient to maintain a large group of witnesses. Be weary of the man in the coat, he may arrive when its time to complete this investigation.</description>
