            <description>Taylin knows the marvels of many natural landscapes. At regular intervals, she will transform the environment, while respecting any area in range of a stabilizer in the form of either a buildable totem or a rare array. In addition, she will provide a boon to construction and mining speed. However, outdoor regions and indoor zones beyond a stabilizerâ€™s range will be altered and damaged, respectively. She does not concern herself with tampering with chance otherwise.</description>
