            <description>Erin Eccentric thinks the best way to enjoy stories is with an animal friend by your side! A liberated highmate turned archotech, she believes life on the Rim can be tough so she'll occasionally soothe the aftermath of a raid or death with a new furry companion. Small animals will sometimes migrate over too! She will often spice things up with more random events while keeping insect infestations less frequent.</description>
